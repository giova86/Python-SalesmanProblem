Genetic algorithm tutorial for Python

Drawing inspiration from natural selection, genetic algorithms (GA) are a fascinating approach to solving search and optimization problems. While much has been written about GA, little has been done to show a step-by-step implementation of a GA in Python for more sophisticated problems. Thatâ€™s where this tutorial comes in! 

In the included notebook, we will demonstrate an end-to-end tutorial of a genetic algorithm used to solve the traveling salesman problem.
